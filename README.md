# Input to JSON C++ code

Input-to-JSON is C++ code that simply takes your input in a form of lines and outputs them as JSON values.
it inserts the necessary syntax such as the "{" , " " " , "," and the "}" after the last arguments     
## Installation

Literally download the C++ source code, load/paste it into a C++ compiler or ide, hit run, and the code will do the rest.


## Usage

Have your inputs in a file named "1.txt" in the same directory. After running the code, you should expect the output within the same directory inside a "output.txt" file.
works only with UNICODE/ASCII english tho, currently.
